Lots of beginners(like me) do not like to use vim's h,j,k,l key to move concur, so I made this game, hopefully can help beginners get used to h,j,k and l.

This is a maze exploring game.
A 15*15 maze is randomly generated, and user('@') need to go to target position('X').
Only h,j,k,l are allowed for controlling.

Maximize the window before starting the game to get better view.

Type :HJKL to start a new game.

Any bug or suggestion: biran0079 at gmail.com


Future plan:
1. Better random number generator is needed. Current version sometimes leads to infinite loop when generating random maze.
2. Need more challenging maze. Better maze construction algorithm is needed.
3. More fancy features...
